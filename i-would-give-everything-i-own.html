Bread Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with youAnd I would give anything I own I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The song is written from the perspective of someone who has lost someone they love dearly, and would do anything to have them back in their life. The opening lines speak to the person's gratitude for all the ways in which their loved one sheltered and protected them throughout their life. They acknowledge that the best years of their life were the ones they spent with this person, and that they owe everything to them.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song is where the true message behind the lyrics comes through. The person singing the song is saying that they would give up anything they own to have their loved one back in their life. Their life, their heart, their home - all of these things are meaningless without the person they love. The second verse goes on to talk about how the person they're singing to taught them how to love, just by being an example, rather than by saying too much. The singer of the song is still holding on to the memories of their time with this person, and no one else can understand the depth of their loss.</p><br><p>The final verse of the song is a warning to anyone who might be taking someone they love for granted. The singer implores the listener to appreciate their loved ones while they still have them, because they could be taken away at any moment. The song ends with the same sentiment as the chorus - the singer would give anything they own just to have their loved one back in their life.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>You sheltered me from harm</u><br>You protected me from danger and harm, keeping me safe and secure</p><br><p><u>Kept me warm, kept me warm</u><br>You provided me with love, comfort, and a sense of belonging that made me feel secure and valued</p><br><p><u>You gave my life to me</u><br>You provided me with direction, purpose, and meaning that helped me grow and develop as a person</p><br><p><u>Set me free, set me free</u><br>You gave me the freedom and independence to pursue my passions and dreams without fear or hesitation</p><br><p><u>The finest years I ever knew Were all the years I had with you</u><br>The best years of my life were spent with you by my side, sharing life's joys and challenges together</p><br><p><u>And I would give anything I own I'd give up my life, my heart, my home I would give everything I own Just to have you back again</u><br>I miss you so much that I would give up everything I have just to be reunited with you once more</p><br><p><u>You taught me how to love What it's of, what it's of You never said too much But still you showed the way And I knew from watching you</u><br>You taught me the true meaning of love by setting an example of how to love unconditionally and without reservation</p><br><p><u>Nobody else could ever know The part of me that can't let go</u><br>No one else can understand the deep, enduring connection I have with you, or the part of me that still longs to be with you</p><br><p><u>Is there someone you know You're loving them so But taking them all for granted?</u><br>Do you have someone in your life whom you love deeply but fail to appreciate fully, taking their presence for granted?</p><br><p><u>You may lose them one day Someone takes them away And they don't hear the words you long to say</u><br>You may one day lose that person you love and regret not telling them how much they mean to you while you still had the chance</p><br><p><u>Just to touch you once again</u><br>All I want is to be reunited with you and experience the simple, intimate pleasure of being close to you once more</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: David Gates</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maHqimq6le6iYjqitnJmsiLXVnpZ%2BrpWnxrW0yKeemIGPhMSv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anders-holm-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Anders Holm Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
