The mounting pressure of competitive exams, including long hours of studying combined with stress, and anxiety, can take a serious toll on a student‚Äôs physical and mental well-being ‚Äì resulting in serious health complications such as a heart attack or a brain stroke. The incident is a reminder to all educational institutions and coaching centers that they must prioritize the health and welfare of their students, offering counseling services and stress management programs to combat the adverse effects of exam-related stress.</p><p>Speaking to TheHealthSite.com on the current surge in the number of heart attack deaths in the country, especially among the youths, Dr. Raghavindra Saxena, Apollo Hospitals, said that most of these cases are happening between 30-45, and the major cause behind it is the stress, and lifestyle habits. For a student, stress is one of the biggest contributors to ailing heart health. ‚ÄúHeart attacks, not discriminating between age or profession, can be the result of various contributing factors such as pre-existing health conditions, stress, or controversial lifestyle choices. It‚Äôs important for everyone, students in particular, to become aware of these risks and instill proper safeguards to prevent such occurrences,‚Äù said Dr Saxena.</p><h2 id=warning-signs-of-heart-attack><strong>Warning Signs of Heart Attack</strong></h2><p>What is the first thing that you can do to keep your heart safe and protect it from such deadly conditions? Understanding the risk factors, taking note of their lifestyle habits, and recognizing the signs and symptoms.</p><p>Here are the top 10 signs of a heart attack that you must never ignore:</p><li>Chest discomfort</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Excessive Sweating</li><li>Irregular heartbeat</li><li>Nausea or vomiting</li><li>Breathlessness</li><li>Anxiety and fear</li><li>Pain in other areas of the body: Heart attack pain can radiate to the arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach. It may also be accompanied by a feeling of indigestion.</li><li>Extreme fatigue or tiredness.</li><p>Madhav‚Äôs death has focused attention, again, on the ‚Äòsilent heart attack‚Äô, which media reports claim has claimed at least four lives in Indore alone over the past few weeks. This tragic event sheds light on the importance of health and lifestyle choices. It‚Äôs a harsh reminder for everyone to prioritize health and for educational institutes to take preemptive measures to ensure student well-being. Let‚Äôs take this incident as a call for creating a safer, healthier environment for students.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/st1.thehealthsite.com/assets/img/ths-logo.svg alt=thehealthsite width=120 height=40 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Don‚Äôt Miss Out on the Latest Updates.<br><span>Subscribe to Our Newsletter Today!</span></p><p>Subscribe Now</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/st1.thehealthsite.com/assets/img/microsoftteams-image.png alt="thehealthsite subscribe now" width=107 height=67 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6O3brTIoJ9mq5OdvLC4jKyrrpyVo8FussCtmKWkqWLAta3Bm5ydZZmjeqmxwKurZqeeYsGprc2kqqChpp67qHnCq6CmnV2ku621zZ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-fox-red-hair-gold-dress-mgk-time100-gala-photos.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Megan Foxs Red Hair &amp;amp; Gold Dress With MGK At Time100 Gala: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
