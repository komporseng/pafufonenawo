When officers arrived, they found the woman, Lyndsey Kennedy, in the water and asked if she needed assistance.</p><p>She ignored them.</p><p>Then, taking it a step further, Kennedy climbed into a storm drain pipe and refused to come out. When police tried to coax her out, she crawled in deeper.</p><p>Eventually, it took a team of Delray Beach Fire Rescue Special Operations members to evacuate Kennedy from the pipe using a ladder and a harness. Kennedy appeared to have minor injuries when she was pulled out, and she was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation.</p><p>Bizarrely, a similar incident occurred nearly two years ago when Kennedy, 43 at the time, was reported missing by her boyfriend. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>WPTV</a>, he notified police that she had disappeared on March 3rd, and on March 23rd, she was found naked in a storm drain pipe.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-420586 alt="Firefighters Rescue Florida Woman From Storm Drain" width=900 height=699 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/firefighters-rescue-florida-woman-from-storm-drain.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-420586 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Delray Beach Police Department</span><span class=caption-body>The first storm drain Kennedy was rescued from in 2021 was about eight feet deep, and it was clear that she had been down there for quite a while.</span></p><p>She told police that she had been swimming in a canal and entered the drain system, but at some point while exploring the tunnels, she got lost.
