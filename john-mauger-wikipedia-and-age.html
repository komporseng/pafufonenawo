Mauger likewise favors keeping his issues private rather than discussing them with the press.</p><p>Mauger was reportedly born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to his loving parents Paul and Pam Mauger. His parents, according to a story by The Daily Item, live in RiverWoods in Lewisburg.</p><p>Mauger was said to have embraced Lewisburg as his home even though he reportedly never resided there.
