Considering how well the first season did, it looks likely that we’ll get a Berlin season 2.</p><p>The first season was announced in 2021 and came out in 2023. If we follow the same timeline, we might need to wait about two more years to find out what happens next in the big heist. So, patience will be key as we look forward to the next chapter.</p><p><strong>Marry My Husband Season 1 Episode 11 Release Date Revealed: What’s Next for Jiwon and Jihyeok?</strong></p><h2 id=berlin-season-2-cast><span id=who-will-be-in-the-berlin-season-2-cast>Who Will Be in The Berlin Season 2 Cast?</span></h2><p>In the first season of the show, the story ended at an exciting point, and it hinted that all the characters from Berlin season 1 might return if there’s a second season. One of the main actors, Pedro Alonso, who plays Berlin, seems very likely to come back since the end of season 1 suggested that he wanted to bring his team together again for more adventures. This means fans can look forward to seeing the whole group reunited, and there’s also a chance that new characters might join in.</p><p>So, if there is a Berlin season 2, here are the actors and the roles they might play:</p><ul><li>Tristán Ulloa as Damián</li><li>Samantha Siqueiros as Camille</li><li>Michelle Jenner as Keila</li><li>Begoña Vargas as Cameron</li><li>Julio Peña Fernández as Roi</li><li>Joel Sánchez as Bruce</li></ul><p>These actors could form the core cast of Berlin season 2, bringing their characters back to life for more thrilling episodes.</p><h2 id=berlin-season-2-story-details><span id=what-can-we-expect-from-berlin-season-2-story>What Can We Expect from Berlin Season 2 Story?</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebigflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/berlin-will-there-be-a-season-2-of-the-spin-off-prequel-series-of-money-heist-1024x576.webp alt="Berlin Season 2" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Berlin is a skilled thief in the TV series. In the first season, he and his gang successfully pulled off a jewel theft, which wasn’t surprising given Berlin’s reputation. Even though they faced some challenges along the way, they managed to escape without getting caught. At the end of the season, we see Berlin and his gang planning another big heist. It seems like the show might follow a pattern of having one heist per season.</p><p>As for what the next heist will be about, we can only guess. The first season also introduced some romantic storylines that could be further explored in future episodes.</p><p>In terms of relationships, Berlin’s connection with Camille seems somewhat positive but there’s an underlying distrust between them. This tension could lead to problems in the second season. Additionally, Berlin’s right-hand man, Damián, has his own relationship issues that might stir up trouble within the group due to his jealousy.</p><p>If the second season introduces new characters, which seems likely, it could create more complications, especially for the couples that formed during the first season. Overall, Berlin’s crew might face even more challenges and conflicts as they delve into new heists and navigate their personal relationships in the upcoming season.</p><p><strong>Tsukimichi Moonlit Fantasy Season 2 Episode 5 Release Date Revealed: What’s Next for Makoto Misumi?</strong></p><h2 id=berlin-season-1-finale-recap>Berlin Season 1 Finale Recap</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebigflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/berlin-alonson-ulloa-1024x664.webp alt="Berlin Season 2" width=1024 height=664 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In Episode 8 of Berlin, Roi and Cameron evade the police by cleverly escaping through tunnels, leaving behind decoys in their RV.
