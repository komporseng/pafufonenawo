Jaycee Horn is believed to have a net worth of <strong>$5</strong> million as of 2021.</p><h2>Chilhood</h2><p>Jaycee DeAndre Horn was born in the city of Alpharetta, Georgia, in the year 1999. His birthdate is November 26th, making him twenty-one years old. He is of African-American ancestry and possesses American citizenship.</p><h2>Professional life and career</h2><p>Jaycee had originally planned to play collegiate football at the University of Tennessee, but she changed her mind and decided to attend the University of California.

Many people also want to know if Panthers’ new cornerback is dating anyone. Jaycee, on the other hand, has been tight-lipped about his dating life. He hasn’t discussed dating or having a girlfriend. Similarly, there are no indicators of him being in a relationship on his social media accounts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jaycee-Horn-2.jpg><p>The footballer, on the other hand, could be dating in secret to avoid unwelcome public attention. With the Carolina Panthers selecting him, he may be too preoccupied with his NFL career to devote much time to dating. Regardless, we believe Jaycee is unmarried unless he publicly declares a relationship.</p><h2>&nbsp;Family background</h2><p>Joe Horn, Jaycee’s father, gave birth to him.
