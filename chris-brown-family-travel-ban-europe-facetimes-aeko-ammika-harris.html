The rapper lives in the U.S., but <strong>Ammika Harris</strong>, 26, and their nearly four-month-old son, <strong>Aeko</strong>, traveled to Germany in Jan. 2020. Now, the family is faced with a double-whammy: Germany is one of the 26 EU nations affected by <strong>Donald Trump‚Äôs</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>travel ban</a> that was enforced on March 13, and it‚Äôs also part of the 27 EU nations whose borders closed on March 18. ‚ÄúThis is not easy on Chris because right now he doesn‚Äôt know exactly when he‚Äôs going to be able to see his son again,‚Äù a Chris source EXCLUSIVELY tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. ‚ÄúFirst there was the US travel ban and now the EU has fully closed their borders so he can‚Äôt go there and visit for at least a month. It‚Äôs rough.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Regardless, Chris is trying to remain optimistic. ‚ÄúChris is doing his best to stay strong,‚Äù our source continues. As for how the family continues to form precious memories together amid this worldwide pandemic, the insider adds, ‚ÄúHe Facetimes with Ammika and he gets to see Aeko that way. And she sends him videos and pictures all day.‚Äù However, our source does say that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the same as getting to hold [Aeko]‚Äù for Chris, who ‚Äúmisses his son.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before the crisis broke out, Ammika was keeping herself busy in Germany, where her mom lives. ‚ÄúAmmika is still modeling and she‚Äôs been doing photo shoots for Fashion Nova in Germany and Chris just wrapped his tour so he‚Äôs enjoying some down time but he‚Äôs always working on something behind the scenes,‚Äù another source EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in January. Ammika not only keeps Chris updated about their son‚Äôs life, but fans as well. She often posts adorable photos of her and Breezy‚Äôs baby boy on Instagram, as you can see below!</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-5></p></a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I have the most beautiful baby boy ü•∞</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ammika Harris</a> (@ammikaaa) on Mar 16, 2020 at 8:29am PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-6></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Even if you are a U.S. resident and can return from Europe, the process isn‚Äôt as simple as booking a flight. American travelers have to fly to one of the 13 pre-approved airports across the U.S., where they‚Äôll be screened. If the traveler tests positive for the new coronavirus, he or she won‚Äôt be allowed back into the country. If the traveler receives the green light, a 14-day self-quarantine is still required.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH10e5BxZpygop7Abq7RqK6nZZaWuqq42Garq5mmmrlursCnZJ6toqS9pnnFmpqerJmisrR5wJ6iqGWRorqqt8Bmn5qqop7AcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-at-blac-chyna-and-tygas-custody-arrangement.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>A look At Blac Chyna And Tygas Custody Arrangement</span></a>
