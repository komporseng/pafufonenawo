He is best known for his roles in movies such as “North to Alaska” (1960) and “The Longest Day” (1962), and for his contributions to TV series including “A Lion Walks Among Us” and “The Wild West”, for which he received a prestigious Primetime Emmy award.</p><p>Have you ever wondered about the wealth accumulated by this multi-talented performer? According to sources, Fabian Forte’s net worth, as of mid-2017, is estimated to exceed an impressive $25 million. His amassed wealth stems from a nearly 60-year career in the entertainment industry, dating back to 1959.</p><h3>Fabian Forte Net Worth $25 million</h3><p>Fabian is the eldest of three sons born to Dominic and Josephine Forte and has Italian ancestry. His entry into the entertainment industry came when he was just 14, after being discovered by Bob Marcucci, co-owner of Chancellor Records, during a personal tragedy with his father. This led him to a hugely successful music career, forming the foundation of Fabian Forte’s wealth.</p><p>With hit singles such as “I’m a Man”, “Turn Me Loose”, and the chart-topping “Tiger”, Fabian quickly rose to stardom and his debut studio album “Hold That Tiger” added a substantial amount to his net worth. However, at the age of 18, he bought out his record contract for a significant sum, effectively ending his music career and setting his sights on acting.</p><p>As a teen idol and rockstar, Fabian signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox and made his acting debut in 1959. This was followed by appearances in highly popular movies such as “High Time” and “North to Alaska”, as well as notable roles in TV series and sitcoms, all of which significantly increased his wealth.</p><p>Despite facing personal challenges, including struggles with alcohol and legal issues, Fabian continued to make his mark in the entertainment industry. His career saw a shift to focus more on acting, with appearances in TV series and movies throughout the 1980s and 1990s, further contributing to his net worth.</p><p>Noteworthy among his personal life, Fabian has been married three times and actively supports charitable organizations including the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association.</p><p><br></p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmidmpqZlrtuss6rq55lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./desean-jackson.html><span>←</span><span>DeSean Jackson - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Salary, Height, Facts</span></a>
