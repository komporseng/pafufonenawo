On June 6, 2020, Anya McKenna-Bruce turned 13 years old. That meant she was born on June 6, 2007, and her current age was 13 years, six months, and six days (as of 12 December 2020).</p><p>Her zodiac sign was Gemini, and she was born on June 6th.</p><h2><span id=Anya_McKenna-Parents_Bruce8217s_and_Siblings>Anya McKenna-Parents Bruce’s and Siblings</span></h2><p>What about Anya McKenna-family Bruce’s life? Angela McKenna-Bruce, an actress, and her husband were her parents (name not known). Her mother is also involved in the film industry. She worked as extras in the film Diversion.</p><p>Anya has two siblings, Ellis McKenna-Bruce and Mia McKenna-Bruce, in addition to her parents. Mia, one of her siblings, is a more well-known actor than Anya. Mia had appeared in popular TV shows such as EastEnders, The Dumping Ground, The Witcher, and others. Mia was best known for her role as Tee Taylor in the Tracy Beaker film series.</p><p>Anya grew up in the Greater London area of England, United Kingdom. She was of British nationality.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p>In 2020, Anya McKenna-Bruce was 13 years old and a growing child. As a result, her height and weight fluctuated over time. But so are so many other things in this place. <strong>Anya stood at 4 ft 8 inches tall. Her weight was approximately 43 kg.</strong></p><p>Her distinguishing features included brown eyes, long dark brown hair, and a white complexion.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW240254911" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW240254911" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP BCX8 SCXW240254911" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Anya was not very active on social media, which was a travesty. Some people have far more social media reach than Anya, but they are nowhere near as talented or deserving of love and praise.</p><p>She only had 5.2k followers on Instagram. It could be because Anya’s posts were not as frequent. Starting in August 2019, Anya had only ten posts. She also maintained a private Instagram account with only 88 followers.</p><p>Anya had even fewer followers on Twitter, with only 109. She, like other celebrities, had a Facebook profile but no page.</p><h2><span id=Anya_McKenna-Bruce_Professional_Life_Career><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW197190366" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW197190366">Anya McKenna-Bruce: Professional Life, Career</span></span><span class="EOP BCX8 SCXW197190366" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Anya McKenna-Bruce began acting when she was one year old. Can you picture it? In 2008, she appeared in the television series Kingdom. Her next role, however, came eight years later in the film London Town.</p><p>Later that year, Anya appeared on the Netflix show Sense8 created by the Wachowski sisters. She played Chelsea in three episodes. Anya had another successful year in 2018, appearing in TV shows such as Damned, Pls Like, and a couple of short films, Rooftop Refugee and O Christmas Tree.</p><p>Cleaning Up on ITV was one of her most important TV shows. The show, which premiered in 2019, was about a single mother who begins working as an insider trader to pay off her debts. Anya portrayed Lily, the protagonist’s daughter.</p><p>Following Cleaning Up, Anya took on smaller roles in TV shows such as Year of the Rabbit, Ghosts, and The Rook. Her upcoming projects include films such as Louis Wain, Zero, and The Banishing, as well as short films such as City of Lost Children, Diversion, and others. So many performances at such a young age.</p><h2><span id=How_much_Anya_McKenna-Bruce_earn><span class="TextRun BCX8 SCXW86590681" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW86590681" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">How much Anya McKenna-Bruce earn?</span></span><span class="EOP BCX8 SCXW86590681" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Anya’s net worth was estimated to be nearly $200 thousand as of December 2021.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Anya McKenna-Bruce&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
