The ex-couple has an alternating weekly schedule and agreed to split time equally during holidays and vacations.</p><p>The couple, who welcomed their daughter Dream in 2016, previously agreed to joint custody in 2017, but it didn’t work out. Rob had previously requested sole custody of their daughter. The new arrangement, however, appears to be working best for the former couple. Both parents agreed to abstain from drugs and alcohol while their child is in their care.</p><h2>A look At Blac Chyna And Tyga’s Custody Arrangement</h2><p>While the details of Rob and Blac Chyna’s custody arrangement are public knowledge, her relationship with former flame Tyga remains unknown.</p><p>Tyga revealed in his most recent response to the reality star’s tweets that he was caring for their son, who lives with him Monday through Saturday. His response revealed that Blac Chyna only gets King Cairo on Sunday.</p><p>Moreover, back in 2016, a Daily Mail report revealed that Tyga filed legal documents to change the custody agreement for King Cairo after Chyna was arrested in an Austin, Texas airport over drug possession and verbal aggression. The details of the former couple’s present custody arrangement have not been explicitly revealed.</p><h2>&nbsp;Blac ChynaTweet Sparks Twitter Debate</h2><p>Taking to her Twitter on Wednesday, March 30, 2022, the 33-year-old wrote: “Yesterday I had to give up 3 of my cars</p><p>my reasons… morals, beliefs, being a single mother, no support I’m a MAMA.” Yesterday I had to give up 3 of my cars … my reasons… morals, beliefs, being a single mother, and no support. I’m a MAMA</p><p>“Single no support child support,” the star wrote in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>Soon, fans began discussing if Rob and Tyga owed Chyna child support if they were looking after the kids during the week.</p><p>“How is that disrespect when they have the kids more than she does? She should be paying them child support,” opined one fan.</p><p>“When the other parent is acting in the child’s life, taking the child on days and clothing feeding the child… is child support warranted?” asked a second user.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhurdNmmaWZk2KwqcXNmmSappRiwbqzwKxknK2jqbylxYyaqauZnpyyrrHNrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-moir.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Moir</span></a>
