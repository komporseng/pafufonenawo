According to the autopsy report from the Travis County Medical Examiner’s Office in Austin, <strong>Texas died of the toxic effects of cocaine, ethanol and fentanyl.</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Former Disney executive Dave Hollis’ death has been ruled an accident. A toxic mix of cocaine, ethanol and fentanyl was the cause, an autopsy said. <a href=#>https://t.co/vc3oTe2UuE</a></p><p>— USA TODAY (@USATODAY) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 25, 2023</a></p><p>The reports identified high blood pressure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which develops when plaque accumulates in the arteries as contributory factors in his death.</p><p>The medical examiner’s report states that Hollis was declared dead at the scene in February after being discovered unconscious by officials at his residence. Hollis had a history of depression, high blood pressure and drug and alcohol misuse.</p><p>Hollis’ heart was enlarged and dilated as well. The report said:</p><p>“Mr. Hollis’s underlying natural disease of the heart would have predisposed it to developing an abnormal rhythm, particularly in the presence of a stimulant drug such as cocaine.”</p><p><strong>Recently we covered the obituary of Buck Trent, if you want to read about his obituary then you can check out our below post:</strong></p><h2><strong>What Did Dave Hollis’ Wife Say After His Death?</strong></h2><p>Jackson, Sawyer, Ford and Noah, the four children he had with his ex-wife.

She said:</p><p>“We still honestly don’t know what happened. I found out after the fact that he had gone to the hospital a couple of times because he was having heart problems, So I think it’s really highly possible he had a heart attack but I don’t know and whatever he died from … we’re still in the same space, which is just deep grief.”</p><p>Our condolences with his family and friends.&nbsp;If you want to get the latest information related to other persons’ obituaries, autopsy reports and more you can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxygI6dmK%2BdXZ28rbjIrGSompmpwqK%2B2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candice-patton.html><span>←</span><span>Candice Patton Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</span></a>
