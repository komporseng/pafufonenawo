Her taking a chance on little old me and saying I want to work with you… even when the camera’s not rolling, she is literally invested in every part of this journey with us. It’s not for TV. She’s in it for real. And the camera just is coming in and seeing her being invested. It’s been so amazing, and she is so supportive…&nbsp; I’m so appreciative, and I’ve never had this type of support from somebody on this magnitude. She is just amazing and a beautiful person inside and out in everything that she does. She exudes beauty.”</p><h2>5.
