While out in New York City, the&nbsp;Jennifer’s Body&nbsp;star debuted fiery <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>red tresses</a> that were parted down the middle and hit to the middle of her back. She even made sure that her glam makeup matched her hair, as her bold lipstick was also a crimson red. To complete her sexy look, Megan paired the outfit with sky-high gold open-toe high heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/megan-fox-red-hair-time-100-gala-machine-gun-kelly-backgrid-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Megan looked gorgeous, per usual, MGK also looked as chic as ever. The “Emo Girl” rapper wore a transparent corset with leather sleeves and matching <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leather pants</a> to the lavish event on Tuesday night. His sheer bustier put his plethora of colorful tattoos on display while he puffed on a cigarette en route to the gala. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dad-of-one</a> completed his rockstar look with a pair of leather boots and styled his blonde locks in a sleek half-up-half-down topknot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The bombshell attended the event to support her fiancé who was also <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>being honored</a> at the event that night. While she was on the red carpet, Megan opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Time&nbsp;</a>about ageism in Hollywood and how she has not dealt with that – yet. “I still look the way I look. And what I mean by that is, as long as you are still a commercial commodity, they don’t come after you,” she said. “So I haven’t experienced that side of Hollywood yet.” The&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;star also told the outlet that being a sex symbol never bothered her. Megan noted that people “seem to not be able to value me for much more beyond” her appearance. “I never had a problem being a sex symbol. I never thought that that was a negative thing,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-three</a> added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/megan-fox-red-hair-time-100-gala-machine-gun-kelly-backgrid-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Megan and MGK’s night on the town comes one week after the pop culture sensation <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clapped back</a> at a hater on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram selfie</a>. “Where your kids at?”, the follower commented, to which Megan did not hesitate to respond to. “wait wait wait. I…have kids?!? Oh my god I knew I forgot something!! Quick, someone call the valet at the Beverly Hills hotel. That’s the last place I remember seeing them. Maybe someone turned them into lost and found,” the 36-year-old wrote back. Many of her followers also backed her up and told the online hater to back off. “she can not [sic] post selfies because she has kids?? Wtf c’mon get a life please,” one of her fans chimed in.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The starlet and MGK <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> on Jan. 11 and are reportedly still planning their wedding, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>.&nbsp;Megan was previously married to actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a>, 49, from 2010 until <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their divorce</a> in 2021.
