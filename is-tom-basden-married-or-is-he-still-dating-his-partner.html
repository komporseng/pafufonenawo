English actor and writer plays the role of teacher, Mr. Short, in The Last Bus. Learn about Tom’s personal life–from his married life to confronting gay rumors–and his net worth in this article.</p><h3><strong>Is Tom Basden Married Or Is</strong><strong> He Still Dating His Partner?</strong></h3><p>Before we talk about Tom’s personal life, we must talk about what he has achieved in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Born in Surrey, London, Tom received his education at King’s College School and Pembroke College. Tom started his career with a one-man show at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he also won Edinburgh Comedy Awards under the “Best Newcomer” category. In the same year, Tom’s short film,&nbsp; The One and Only Herb McGwyer Plays Wallis Island, won UK Film Council Kodak Award for Best British Short Film.</p><p>Some of Tom’s acting credits include The Last Bus, After Life, Mandy, Plebs (also wrote and produced), Quacks, W1A, The Wrong Mans, The Armstrong and Miller Show, and Star Stories, among others.</p><p>As a writer, he has written Fresh Meat, a British comedy-drama TV series, which gave him a nomination for the 2012 BAFTA Craft Awards in the Break-Through Talent category. His other writing credits include Gap Year, Cowards, Me and My Monsters, and Pandemonium, among others.</p><p>Talking about his theatre works, his 2010 play Party received positive reviews from The Guardian, which called it “an idiosyncratic and highly enjoyable piece performed beautifully by a crack cast of upcoming comics.” Tom was also longlisted for the stage adaptation of Franz Kafka’s The Trial called Joseph K. in the 2011 Evening Standard Theatre Awards Most Promising Playwright.</p><p>Everyone would expect a prolific and handsome actor like Tom Basden to have a woman in his life who is madly in love with him. Unfortunately, that is not the case, or that may be the case but it’s just that the public might not know anything about it.</p><p>That being said, Guardian reported about Tom Basden having a partner (wife) and a kid in an article published on July 27, 2020. However, his Instagram is of no help when it comes to finding out whether the After Life actor is married.</p><p>Although we may not know about his relationship status in real life, the popular actor has had several wives in many of his projects. For example, in the 2020 show, The Debrief, Tom Basden is married to a terrific actress Rebecca Humphries and in the five-part series, the couple dissects friends, relations, and events with humor and a heavy dose of cynism after a family outing.</p><p>With everything said, we, at Gossip Next Door, are not sure if Tom was married or dating someone as of April 2022.</p><h3><strong>Does Tom Basden Have A Child?</strong></h3><p>Similar to his relationship status, we are not sure if Tom had any child as of this writing.

Despite having countless debates on his sexuality on the Internet, Tom has chosen not to comment on any of them.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Tom Basden’s Parents And Siblings?</strong></h3><p>We are sorry but we have nothing but disappointment to give to people who are here to know about Tom’s parents and siblings. with that said, once a Facebook page named AFL Zero Hanger pointed out the uncanny resemblance between tom and former Australian football player daniel Gorringe, but we can safely give you confirmation that daniel is not Tom’s long lost brother.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h3><strong>When Is Tom Basden’s Birthday?</strong></h3></li></ul><p>Born in 1980, Tom Basden celebrates her birthday on the 30th of November.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Tom Basden?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Quacks star, Tom Basden, stands tall at a towering height of 6 feet.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Tom Basden Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>With projects such as Plebs, After Life, and Quacks under his belt, Tom Basden is certainly rich.
