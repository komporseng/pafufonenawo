The mother was watching her children in the water when she noticed hands flailing in the water in front of her.</p><p class=Zg>A group of three children were pulled into the deep waters of Lake Michigan after being swept up by rip currents. DeWitt, who was five months pregnant at the time, was the only one close enough to come to their aid.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Blue and white life saver buoy attached to a pole. | Pexels/ Athena</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>SAVING THREE LIVES</strong></p><p class=Zg>The children, all under the age of 15, were being slammed against the pier wall as DeWitt came to their rescue. She leaned over the wall, risking falling in with them to reach down and pull them out. DeWitt <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/alyssa.dewitt.3/posts/10158988362870622>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"They could barely keep their heads above water.

Both the mother and baby checked out as healthy.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>HEROIC MOTHER</strong></p><p class=Zg>It was reported that two of the children were swept into the deeper water of Lake Michigan when an older kid saw them in trouble and followed to try and help them, which landed them all in trouble.</p><p class=Zg>Manistee City Police Chief Josh Glass praised DeWitt's actions, saying that the situation may have turned out much worse without her. In a statement, Glass <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/pregnant-woman-rescues-3-kids-from-drowning-in-lake-michigan/>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"Without the actions of this heroic young lady, [this] could have easily turned out differently."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>FATAL FALL</strong></p><p class=Zg>The Lake Michigan incident had a happy ending, but the result was not so fortunate for others.

Kyle was at Center Hill Lake with his wife and two other couples when the fatal fall occurred.</p><p class=Zg>DeKalb County Sheriff Patrick Ray shared that Anderson wanted to jump off a rock bluff into the water, but as he climbed up, one of the bluffs gave way, and he fell into the water, hitting several rocks on the way down.</p><p class=Zg>The father's body was located 165 feet below the lake's surface.
