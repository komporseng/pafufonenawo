As The Sunday Times confirmed (via The Guardian) Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit social media entirely after defecting from the royal family, reasoning that they would rather focus their attention on building a life for themselves in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sussexes reportedly had no plans to re-engage with their millions of followers on Instagram after encountering a huge amount of hate online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tor5iuerG%2ByKeanmWYlr%2BzxYyrnJqknK56qa3TnqpmrKeewbWx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tigres-uanl-vs-toluca-history.html><span>←</span><span>Tigres UANL vs. Toluca Historical Head-to-Head</span></a>
