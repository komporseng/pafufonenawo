His two adorable pets also make regular appearances on his TikTok videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler attended West Mesquite High School and is a graduate of Michigan State University. He was a top-ranked cornerback in the country when he was in high school. ESPN listed him among Midland's top prospects.&nbsp;</p><p>He recorded a career-high 25 tackles and tied for second on the team with a career-high five pass break-ups in playing all 13 games during his senior season in Michigan State.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, he has entered the television world and is seen on season 3 of All Americans.&nbsp;</p><a title=@joshbutlertv href=#>@joshbutlertv</a> Super stars @Kai Gaines 🎥 🐶🤠🐶 <a title=joshbutlertv href=#>#joshbutlertv</a> <a title=roxyandremi href=#>#roxyandremi</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=comedy href=#>#comedy</a> <a title=dogs href=#>#dogs</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=memes href=#>#memes</a> <a title="♬ Super Gremlin - Kodak Black" href=#>♬ Super Gremlin - Kodak Black</a><h2 id=nfl-who-are-josh-butler-p>NFL: Who Are Josh Butler Parents? Father Steven And Mother Ladrida</h2><p>He has the saddest story that no person should ever go through. Both of Josh Butler's died when he was in college.</p><p>His father, Steven Butler, passed away due to a heart attack in 2017. The former cornerback was not even over his father's death when he lost his mother one and a half years later.</p><p>Ladrida Butler, his mother, was diagnosed with breast cancer and died of its complication, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS Sports</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh adopted two dogs, Roxy and Remi, to cope with the loss of his parents. It is probably why he shares a really close bond with his pets.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, parents accompany their children on the football field for senior day. However, Josh took his dogs on the field in the absence of his family.&nbsp;</p><p>He also thanked his coach for allowing him to take them out on the field via his Twitter account. He concluded the post by remembering his mother and father.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Senior Day! 💚🙏🏾 Thank you Coach D for allowing <a href=#>@Roxy_RemiTv</a> to walk with me.

Now, he is an actor and a popular social media star.</p><p>His Instagram and Twitter have amassed more than 77K and 10.3K followers, where he often collaborates with various brands.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, he may have collected a sound net worth from his career.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=is-josh-butler-married-wi>Is Josh Butler Married? Wife & Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Josh Butler is not married so the question about his wife and children goes out of the picture.</p><p>Also, it's uncertain if Butler has a girlfriend. The All Americans actor has not introduced his partner on social media and has kept his romantic life under wraps currently.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout his career, he has not been linked with any possible romantic partners as well, so it's safe to assume he is not in a relationship right now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiln6RdrLWwecCrnGain6i1bq7UraOeql2lrrOxza2q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./189690-blake-shelton-releases-lyric-video-nobod-html.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Shelton Releases Lyric Video for 'Nobody but You' Which Features Girlfriend Gwen Stefani</span></a>
