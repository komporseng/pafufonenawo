He had been in this position for a considerable amount of time. This knowledge is the source of a significant amount of anguish for all of us, and it is with deep remorse that we convey it to each and every one of you in this communication. He had courageously fought a long-term illness, and Peter continued to support One Can with the highest degree of passion and enthusiasm despite the many treatments and hospital visits he had to endure.</p><p>Despite his sickness, he had been an inspiration to others around him. In spite of all that had happened, he was a source of motivation for everyone around him. Since he began volunteering for the food bank in 2011, which was not long after it had been established, he has put in a lot of hard work over the years, and for all of his hard work, we will be eternally thankful to him. On Friday, July 28, at 10:45 in the morning, funeral services for Peter will be held at the Amersham Crematorium. Peter passed away on July 18. The 24th of July was the day Peter went away.</p><p>After the conclusion of this event, the expression of gratitude will take place in the Wesley Methodist Church in High Wycombe at thirteen o’clock in the afternoon. Attendance is encouraged from any and all interested parties. In this most difficult time, we would like to ask you to join us in offering our most heartfelt condolences to Peter’s family. We know that they are going through a very difficult period right now. We are aware that this is a challenging request, and we appreciate your understanding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwvMStnKtll6eyprqMqJmirKWWv7p5wGajop6VYrGmsMicmK2dlGLBsHnSnqmvoZOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-rose.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Rose</span></a>
