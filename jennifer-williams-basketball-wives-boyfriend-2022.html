While her personal life has come under intense scrutiny following her involvement in some turmoil involving her divorce & ex-boyfriend <strong>Tim Norman.</strong></p><p>Neither of them has shared any images on social media to establish their relationship status. Despite this, it's evident that people are rooting for them and looking for any indications that they're together. As seen on Basketball Wives, Jennifer and Jelani have been on multiple dates.</p><p>Jennifer Williams has stated that she wishes to take her time with him. Moreover, Jennifer believes that there is something exceptional about Jelani and that he is fulfilling all of the prayers she asked God to send her. Likewise, Jelani stated that he enjoys spending time with Jennifer. He is open to children and marriage because he is at an age when he can support a family.

She and Eric married in 2007 and appeared to be doing well until she filed for divorce three years later.</p><p>Fortunately, they were able to part ways amicably.Jennifer Williams left the marriage with half of their joint property and was prepared to move on with her life. On the other hand, she was romantically linked to an actor named <strong>Cisco Risado</strong> in 2014. Their relationship, however, was brief.</p><p><strong>Tim Norman,</strong> the star of Sweetie Pies, has been her most visible relationship after her divorce. Although she undoubtedly felt he was her perfect match at the time, she was absolutely incorrect. Jennifer and Norman dated for a little over a year until she accused him of stalking and harassing her in 2017, according to Atlanta Black Star. The following year, she went to court and asked for a permanent restraining order against him.</p><p>If he comes within 150 feet of Jennifer Williams and violates the present restraining order, he will risk jail time. Jennifer discussed barring him from her phone and social media pages once they were through in order to find serenity.</p><p>Fortunately, it doesn't appear that he'll be approaching her anytime soon. He pleaded guilty in June 2022 to his role in the 2016 murder of his nephew,<strong> Andre Montgomery Jr.,</strong> and now faces life in prison.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoywoKWkmZa6tHnBmqqknaSXrq24jLCgr52jYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGJ%2FcX6RaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-bridges-pics-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Bridges: Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
