<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kanye West unveils 'Wolves' music video</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Kanye West doesn’t do things by halves. He’s unveiled the visuals&nbsp;for ‘Wolves’, which doubles up as Balmain’s Autumn/Winter 16 campaign video.</p><p>West&nbsp;has joined forces with Balmain’s creative director Olivier Rousteing for the visual,&nbsp;who contacted the rapper after he&nbsp;debuted his album The Life of Pablo&nbsp;at Madison Square Garden in February. &nbsp;Rousteing was so moved by ‘Wolves’ that he wanted to use it for his campaign.</p><p>Of course, West agreed and the video was shot a few days after the Met Gala earlier this year. In fact, Kanye and wife Kim Kardashian-West are seen wearing the futuristic Balmain outfits they first showcased at the Met Gala during the video.</p><p>Speaking about the visual, Rousteing stated:</p><p>Although I love my job, the collections and the shows can end up being a lot of hard work. The campaigns, though, are always an absolute joy to be a part of, from start to finish. This one, in particular, was a dream come true. It was shot right after the Met Ball. Pascal, Steven and I pulled together as many members of the “Balmain Army” who were in town and we spent two days creating a true collaboration—beginning with a riff on a Balmain after-party, and mixing dance, music, lyrics, photography and fashion in a new way that reflects the unique, diverse and modern side of this historic house. I couldn’t be happier with the result—or more grateful to all who played a part in its creation.</p><p>The stunning visual features a whole host of Balmain Army models, as well as Kim. There are also cameos from Kylie Jenner, Cindy Crawford,&nbsp;Sara Sampaio, Joan Smalls, and Alessandra Ambrosio. Additionally, the visual features Vic Mensa and Sia, who appear on the track.</p><p>The seven-minute visual is entirely black and white and was directed by Steven Klein. During the video, we see close ups of Kimye crying. There are also shots of Kim with hands touching her face and body as she cries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/kanye-west-unveils-wolves-music-video-01.gif><p>Of&nbsp;the visual, creative director Pascal Dangin <a href=#>said</a>: “Olivier, Kanye, Kim, Sia, Vic and all the other members of the new Balmain army rise up to a fusion of fashion and music. The sublime beauty of Balmain, the incredible power of the lyrics, the art of the dance – It’s a collaboration in the truest sense of the word.”</p><p>Check out the ‘Wolves’ video below.</p><p></p><p>Share your thoughts on Kanye West’s latest offering with us on Twitter @CelebMix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuKK62J5ksJ2jqXq2utWeoKWrXay8rcLErGSmraOesG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./friends-characters-ranked-by-intelligence.html><span>←</span><span>From Ross to Rachel: Friends Characters Ranked by Intelligence</span></a>
