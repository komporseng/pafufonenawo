Legends of bodybuilding have inspired millions in the pursuit of building a better body. Today, we will look at the top 10 bodybuilders of all time and the path their career took, how who all got a major achievement in bodybuilding.</p><h2>1. Arnold Schwarzenegger</h2><p><strong>Nickname:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The Austrian Oak<br><strong>Mr. Olympia Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>7<br><strong>Mr. Universe Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>3</p><p data-id=2e0ef724-256f-4a0f-887c-b9b2f54558ac data-mce-fragment=1>Bodybuilding for most of us is associated with the great Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is widely known for his action role in film, as well as his time as Governor of California, but his influence expands outside this activity. Thanks to his huge size, massive upper body and incredible attention to detail on his lower half, he will be remembered as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time. Their annual Arnold Classic bodybuilding competition and his role in calling the action at contests and expos confirm that he continues to have a lasting influence on the sport1.</p><h2>2. Ronnie Coleman</h2><p><strong>Mr. Olympia Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>8</p><p data-id=3224ffc8-1639-48ed-9560-51ca562ad876 data-mce-fragment=1>Ronnie Coleman is known as a giant in the bodybuilding community, having taken home a record eight straight Mr. Olympia titles. From his massive size and dedication to gain mass and definition, Coleman's advice can be found in training videos, endorsements, and other media sources. Not to mention that his catchphrases and wise sayings have won over the hearts of fans and aspiring bodybuilders1.</p><h2>3. Dorian Yates</h2><p><strong>Mr. Olympia Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>6</p><p data-id=3ee13c2a-86ef-4470-b366-81ccc113c0b3 data-mce-fragment=1>Dorian Yates, otherwise known as "The Shadow", had vacated from the spotlight before shows which is how he came by his nickname, and would return to the stage in top shape and win – often leaving the favorites down to the second and third places. A veritable badass for High Intensity Training (HIT), Yates distinguishes himself as one of the figureheads in the field due to his staunch support of short, intense training periods. It is also his devotion to the ethos of the anonymous private life as well as refusal to accept endorsements and give interviews in order to preserve his personal life, that solidify his role in bodybuilding1.</p><h2>4. Eugen Sandow</h2><p><strong>Notable Achievement:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Crowned "The father of modern bodybuilding"</p><p data-id=79cdaae3-5d77-4811-ba91-52677ad213ae data-mce-fragment=1>Eugen Sandow- father of bodybuilding. He was the first bodybuilder who presented his muscles for the fans using his poses in the form in which we know it now. His focus on Proportions and Physique, combined with the Grecian Ideal, made him the most perfectly developed man of his day.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Frank Zane</h2><p><strong>Mr. Olympia Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>3</p><p data-id=bf0ff484-b821-4dfd-bacf-27fa549dcdeb data-mce-fragment=1>Although it can seem very sleek to some, Frank Zane stands for the idea that bodybuilding can be approached from aesthetics, from symmetry. Nevertheless, despite a genetically modest frame, Zane's commitment to aesthetic appeal nabbed him three Olympia titles in the late 1970s. His evolution from a naturally skinny to a balance of being big and aesthetic serves as a motivation to many determined bodybuilders</p><h2>6. Ken "Flex" Wheeler</h2><p data-id=255b99c9-4724-4aa2-9e8a-6cdec6878b74 data-mce-fragment=1>Ken "Flex" Wheeler is A lot of people say one of the greatest bodybuilders to never win an Olympia. The tall, solid, and shapely body of Zane, his significantly different from anyone else's in a "golden era" full of great bodybuilders, looks set his legendary era in cement.</p><h2>7. Bob Paris</h2><p data-id=2d0bfdab-663d-4035-b31a-3719c36a776f data-mce-fragment=1>Bob Paris came 7th in the Olympia, but his symmetry and aesthetic qualities weren't done justice in his highest Olympia finish. Quite literally, he changed bodybuilding forever, mostly in the field of aesthetics.</p><h2>8. Jay Cutler</h2><p><strong>Mr. Olympia Titles:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>4</p><p data-id=5d0a0c72-2b56-4ede-b722-7160f6d09490 data-mce-fragment=1>Bodybuilding just like any other sport has a hero vs villain dynamic which can be seen by the relationship between Jay Cutler and Ronnie Coleman. Unfortunately for Cutler he was around during a generation when one of the goats of Bodybuilding Ronnie Coleman was around who defeated him in many competitions. Non the less Cutler was a all-time great and could potentially be higher on this list.</p><h2>9. Ronnie Williams</h2><p data-id=cc813786-3d11-45a0-87dc-767b2a037e03 data-mce-fragment=1>At more than 250 competition wins, Ronnie Williams is heralded as the most prolific natural bodybuilder in the history of the sport.</p><h2>10. Jeff Seid</h2><p data-id=6abab1d5-936a-4ced-9c98-e47d5da962e5 data-mce-fragment=1>One guy making a pretty big splash in the bodybuilding world is Jeff Seid… and no, not because he turned pro at the age of 19 (youngest ever IFBB Pro in history).</p><p data-id=c36f3da5-542a-4b47-b72d-efb574a9acd4 data-mce-fragment=1>These best 10 muscle heads not just have a record breaking success in the game but additionally have ingrained their adoration for lifting loads and muscle advancement upon the ages to come with their assurance, control, grit that they used to keep up over their active man body and keeping up their physical make-up. Their lasting impact on the sport of bodybuilding still translates to the world of muscle and motivates you to keep pushing the torso boundaries.</p><p data-id=c5494b4a-d928-4940-b40b-41bf9c331612 data-mce-fragment=1>Thus, the final touch on the legacies of these top 10 bodybuilders of all time is a solid reminder about the immense influence of dedication, discipline, and determination towards fitness and muscle building in a nutshell. Their record-breaking feats continue to inspire and influence the bodybuilding world, making a resounding mark that would last for generations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6tn55lpaHBqrnArZxmpJmowW67xWaroZ1dqbyxeZBpZJunlK6vtrXLnZyrq12ks26ty6VkraGdmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-spielberg-kate-capshaw-boat-cannes-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Spielberg Cuddles With Wife Kate Capshaw In New Boat Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
