He has also started his own YouTube channel – FaZe Adapt, also adopted as his professional name – on which he has more than 4.5 million subscribers.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich FaZe Adapt is, as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Adapt’s net worth is as high as $700,000, an amount earned through his successful career, active since 2011.</p><h3>FaZe Adapt Net Worth $700,000</h3><p>FaZe Adapt is the son of Peter and Nancy, and has four sisters, Milan, Paris, Sydney, and Vienna.</p><p>From an early age, FaZe Adapt was drawn to video games, and as he got older became more focused on playing a variety of games. There is no information about his education.</p><p>He started his channel in 2011, and since then has become an internet sensation; his first video – “SoaR Adapt: Joined SoaR + Killcam“ – was uploaded on the 23rd December 2011, but didn’t reach too many viewers as it has attracted less than 100,000 views. However, a number of other videos have since propelled FaZe Adapt to stardom, and in addition to gaming videos, he began uploading prank videos, which has also contributed to his popularity and net worth as well. Some of his most popular videos include “Creepy Guy Stands Outside Faze House at 1 AM”, “My Little Sister Drinks Gamma…”, and “Reacting to Rich Kids Snapchats! #3 (So Cringy)”, all of which have well over five million views, accumulatively reaching close to 900 million views on his account, which has in large part increased his net worth.</p><p>Thanks to his increasing popularity, he became a member of the FaZe Clan, which has also added to his net worth. Though he is not competing in events, he has used his YouTube popularity to contribute to the whole team’s popularity.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, most of FaZe Adapt’s intimate details have been hidden in the media, though it is known that he was in a relationship with Instagram superstar Adrianna Scaley through 2016.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp%2BYs51dlrGivNNmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./analyse-talavera-boyfriend-family-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>The Challenge Analyse Talavera Boyfriend Jack Matthews</span></a>
