Tim’s passing, resulting from a medical emergency, has left the entire community in shock.</p><a class=whatsapp href=#>Join Our Whatsapp Group</a><p>Tim Kratochvil held the position of Superintendent/High School Principal at Pawnee High School in Springfield, Illinois. A graduate of Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, and the University of Illinois Springfield, he had a rich history in education and sports coaching.

Additionally, he held the position of Junior High/High School Principal at Pawnee Community School District.</p><p>Hailing from Mount Olive, Tim’s athletic prowess was well-known, particularly in baseball.

Tim was a pillar of the community, a father and a positive force for the youth in the Pawnee community.<br>Revelation 21:4 “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”</p><p>A devoted family man, Tim leaves behind cherished memories as a loving husband and father of three. His passion for sports and education was undeniable, and he had a remarkable journey from being recognized as one of the county’s top 22 catchers by USA Today when he graduated from Mount Olive High School in 1992. During his high school years, he participated in football and basketball for four years, earning four letters. His legacy in Carbondale’s sports history includes setting records in doubles, home runs, and RBIs, making him Carbondale’s all-time batting leader.
