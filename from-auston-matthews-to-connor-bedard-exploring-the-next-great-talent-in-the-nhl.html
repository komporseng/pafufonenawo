Since then, he has proven to be a force to be reckoned with, showcasing his remarkable shooting ability and offensive prowess. Matthews' goal-scoring ability is unparalleled, as evidenced by his back-to-back hat tricks at the start of the current season. If he manages to score another goal, he will become the first Maple Leaf to achieve seven goals in a three-game span since the 1986-87 season.
