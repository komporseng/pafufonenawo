The horror film is the fourth installment of the franchise, and it was intended to be the series’ final installment, but it was later followed by two sequels. During this time, she also worked frequently with fellow “Harry Potter” actor Jessie Cave on several short videos she wrote for the website Pindippy.</p><p>In 2013, she played the character Sarah in the short film “Lashes.” The fourth season of the television show “Falling Skies” was her next notable project as a regular. She relocated to Vancouver for the series’ filming but only stayed for one season, though she reprised her role in the final episode.
